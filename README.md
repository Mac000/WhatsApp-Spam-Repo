# Whatsapp-Spam
This repository contains the script to send a for a given number of times message on Whatsapp Web

### Disclaimer
I made it just for fun and as a bit of challenge to myself. I am not responsible what the user does with it. Use 
it on your own risk. My suggestion is DO NOT test it randomly. You wanna have fun with it? have fun with those people 
who are ok and allow you to do that.
Even though I would like it functional that people can use it whenever they want. However, 
updates are needed when WhatsApp updates. I do not promise any support or maintenance as I have many other things 
to take care of. 

### How to use
First, let's make it clear that it only works on Whatsapp Web.
Open the whatsapp web, Access the developer tools on your browser. For Chrome, it's Ctrl+Shift+i
Go to "Console" tab 
Copy the script from "Ultimate_WhatsApp_Spam_Refactored_DEV" OR "Ultimate_WhatsApp_Spam_Refactored_Min". Both files
contain same code. "Ultimate_WhatsApp_Spam_Refactored_Min" just contains the code in minified form.
Bang 'Enter" once you have pasted script in console tab.

### Update March 07 2022
I have decided to make the repository public (let's hope there won't be any mess for me). Not only that, I am making it
open source. If anyone wants to extend it, you are welcome. At the moment, I do not have any plans/idea about pull requests
stuff. However, anyone is free to fork it and do whatever you want it. Here is a 
[Medium article](https://medium.com/@mactavish10101/power-of-dom-manipulation-create-a-simple-spam-script-for-whatsapp-web-7d2cdacaa852) 
that presents the very basic version of this script. That basic version got expanded into this script.
This decision was inspired by Russian Invasion of Ukraine. Let's spam with text before Mr. Putin goes nuts
and spams us with Nukes.

Lastly, If you can reach Putin on WhatsApp, I think it would be good use to spam him to tell him to stop
this un-necessary bloodshed and let the people live in peace!
